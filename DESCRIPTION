Description: 
  Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models using hierarchical
  priors. There is a prior that combines information across responses and one
  that combines information across covariates, as well as a standard spike and
  slab prior for comparison. An MCMC samples from the marginal posterior
  distribution for the 0-1 variables indicating if each covariate belongs to the
  model for each response.
